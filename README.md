# ReplicationPackage
With the submission of this research a replication package is included. The replication package is a zip file which contains:
* A pdf with the thematic analysis write up for each task seperately, tables of ANOVA and Tukey-HSD results and the scenarios used
* Questionnaires used
* The analysis code which produced all results and Figures in this report, found in the DataAnalysis folder.
* All data required for analysis, found in the DataAnalysis folder.

To run the analysis code:
* Ideally open the analysis jupyter notebook on Google Colab.
* Upload files entry_questionnaire_complete.csv, post_task_data.csv, and interaction_data_complete.json in your workspace.
* Run the whole notebook.

Otherwise if you run jupyter notebook locally you may need to install some of the packages used. An already run version of the notebook is anyway provided.
